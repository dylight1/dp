# Project Workflow

1. Complete a task from `implementation-steps.md`.
2. Mark the completed task with [x] in `implementation-steps.md`.
3. Commit changes using the following conventions:
   - Commit messages should be descriptive and follow this format:
     [Type] Short description
   - If the commit relates to an issue, mention it at the end.
4. Push changes to GitHub.
5. Before moving to the next task:
   - Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for manually testing the completed task so it can be verified that everything works correctly.
6. Move to the next task.


# Issue Handling Rules

- If instructed to open an issue, use the MCP to generate it.
- At the end of every issue description, add:

- Add summaries and next-step suggestions after completing each task.
- Ensure all code and steps strictly follow `requirements.md`.
